   2. Click **"New notebook"**
   3. Click **"File" → "Upload notebook"**
   4. Upload the `RA_Assignment_2.ipynb` file included in the same folder as this README.
   5. Run the notebook.

2. **Using Anaconda**
   1. [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   2. Open **Anaconda Navigator**
   3. Launch **Jupyter Notebook**
   4. Open the `RA_Assignment_2.ipynb` file included in the same folder as this README.
   5. Run the notebook.

3. **Using a Shared Google Link**
